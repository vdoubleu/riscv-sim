# RISCV Emulator

This is an emulator for the RISCV computer architecture.

This was built in a way to sort of emulate how a computer actually works, and as such the program is split into various parts in a way that follows this methodology.

There is first an input layer that reads in the input.
It will tokenize it and then assemble it.
